This is the first project I made for 100 Days of Code Challenge. For this, I followed a tutorial by @alamorre, and his code can be found in this repository: 
https://github.com/alamorre/fullstack-chat
Youtube: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Fzv-rgwcFKk

I plan on using this as a base, amd incorporate it in a project I intend to make with my classmates further down the line.
